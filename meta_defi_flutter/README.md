# MetaMask DeFi Flutter App

This sample Flutter application demonstrates how to connect to MetaMask using
[walletconnect_dart](https://pub.dev/packages/walletconnect_dart) and
[web3dart](https://pub.dev/packages/web3dart).

## Running

1. Replace `YOUR_INFURA_KEY` in `lib/main.dart` with your Infura project ID or
   another Ethereum RPC endpoint.
2. Run `flutter pub get` inside the `meta_defi_flutter` directory.
3. Launch the app on a simulator or device.
4. Press **Connect MetaMask** to open MetaMask via WalletConnect.

This example simply displays the connected account address.
